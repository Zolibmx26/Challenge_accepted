Steps to run the program option1:
  - Download the .exe file together with libstdc++-6.dll and save them in the same folder.
  - Open Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where the files are saved.
  - Type the name of the .exe file followed by the associated arguments.
  - Example: convertRoman IV or convertRoman 4; lookandsay -l 2514 or lookandsay -r 2514; conway 2 10 10 1,1 1,2 2,1 2,2 0,6 1,6 2,6
  
Steps to run the program option2 (needs to have GCC compiler installed):
  − Open a new terminal window or cmd if you are on windows.
  − Change the directory to the directory in which you have your source.cpp file. For example, if it is in C:/Users/Dell/Documents, enter your command line −
           $ cd 'C:/Users/Dell/Documents'
  − Now enter the following command to compile the source file using g++.
           $ g++ -o <name-you-want-to-give> source.cpp
           In place of <name-you-want-to-give> replace it by any name like myprogram, etc.
  − Run it! Now you can run the program using −
          $ ./myprogram - followed by the associated arguments as in the examples above
